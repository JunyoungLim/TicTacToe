# TicTacToe A.I.

TicTacToe Artificial Intelligence project based on minimax algorithm.

Supports both player vs player mode and player vs AI mode.

AI mode supports 6 different difficulty levels
* 0 : (practice) : sporadic defense, sporadic attack (random move)
* 1 : beginner : basic attack, sporadic defense
* 2 : easy : basic attack, basic defense
* 3 : medium : basic moves, strategy limitation level 3 on defense and attack
* 4 : hard : basic moves, strategy limitation level 4 on defense
* 5 : impossible : invincible

AI difficulty is based on the depth of recursive logic, in which level 0 has depth level 0 (no minimax recursion) and level 5 calculates every possible state.

## Getting Started

No specific installation or preparation required. As long as the directory structure is maintained, the program will run properly. The main class will be Console.java if the console interface is used, MainGUI if graphic interface is used.
